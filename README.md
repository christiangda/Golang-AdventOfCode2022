Golang Implementation of Advent of Code 2022 (https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Usage

Having [Go (Golang)](https://go.dev/) installed, and this repository cloned, you can run the following commands to execute the solutions.

### Unit Tests

All the puzzles have their own unit tests, so you can run them with the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Day 01

#### Puzzle 01

Remember that each puzzle has its own input file, so you need to specify it as a parameter.

Using mine input file:

```bash
go run day_01/puzzle_01/main.go -input day_01/puzzle_01/input.txt
```

#### Puzzle 02

Remember that each puzzle has its own input file, so you need to specify it as a parameter.

Using mine input file:

```bash
go run day_01/puzzle_02/main.go -input day_01/puzzle_02/input.txt
```
